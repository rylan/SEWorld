The SEWORLD mailing list provides a valuable service to the Software Engineering community by 
helping disseminate time-sensitive information relevant to the field of software engineering. 
However, if you are like me, you find yourself buried under SEWORLD emails losing track of important 
items. The SEWorld application is specifically design to help you identify and keep track of Software 
Engineering information relevant to you.
